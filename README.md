# perfection

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/datashaman/perfection.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datashaman/perfection)

Single-thread chat app! j/k

Interesting bits:

* ReactJS
* Flux architecture
* PouchDB local storage in browser
* Remote sychronization to CouchDB
* Operates offline, will synch when online

It works well with more than one person synching
to the same remote.

The world's most private chat app (if you use secure HTTPS URLs)!
